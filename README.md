# Smartphone Data Analysis
Tidy data set generated from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone ([download](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)) with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

A full description of the original data is available here [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

#### Running the script

* Ensure that the original data is unzipped in a folder called 'UCI HAR Dataset'
* Run `source('run_analysis.R')`
* The file "smartphone_average_activity.txt" should then be generated in the same folder
